========
I usually develop for iOS, but in the absence of better MPD client for OS X i picked up this project and fixed it up a little. Updating codebase to modern ObjC standarts without breaking it is a nice exercise too. ;)

New features since 2008:
------------------------
* 64bit build (universal binary)
* Shuffle button (by [biappi](https://github.com/biappi))
* Updated code for handling Apple Remotes
* Updated Growl with 10.8 Notification Center support
* Growl when stream title changes, fall back to icyName and filename

Download built .app
-------------------
Fetch latest version from [download section](https://github.com/TheStalwart/Theremin/downloads), and shut up Gatekeeper in System Preferences -> Security & Privacy.
