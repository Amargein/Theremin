========
I usually develop for iOS, but in the absence of better MPD client for OS X i picked up this project and fixed it up a little. Updating codebase to modern ObjC standarts without breaking it is a nice exercise too. ;)

New features since 2008:
------------------------
* Updated Growl with 10.8 Notification Center support
* Shuffle button (by [biappi](https://github.com/biappi))
* Updated code for handling Apple Remotes
* 64bit build (universal binary)
